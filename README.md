### Commands

```
node server.js
```
then navigate to 
```
localhost:8000 in browser
```

### What App Does

This full stack BURGER App is using Node JS Express Handlebars and custom Object-Relational Mapping (ORM). It uses Node and MySQL to query and route data to the app and Handlebars to generate the HTML. Updates are made by Ajax calls to the specified POST and PUT routes.
The page is styled with Bootstrap, Google Fonts, and additional custom CSS. Handlebars creates the front end using my designed HTML code with light jQuery for the form handling.
